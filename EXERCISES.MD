### Exercise 1 - Add a URL Parameter

Read the docs and see if you can add a URL parameter to one of the routes,
retrieve it in our handler and output it to the resulting HTML.

_HINT: See [these docs](https://github.com/go-chi/chi#url-parameters) if you
need some guidance.
You shouldn't need to use context, just use `URLParam` method_

### Exercise 2 - Experiment with builtin middleware

Chi provides quite a few builtin middleware. One is the Logger middleware,
which eill track how long each request is taking.
Try to add it to your application, then only a single route.
